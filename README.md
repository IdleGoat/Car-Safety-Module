## Problems

## Solution

#### Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive car safety module that enhances vehicle safety by integrating various functionalities. The module utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances between vehicles in real-time and provides immediate feedback to the driver through a clear display. It also incorporates throttle control, allowing drivers to adjust acceleration and speed accurately. An automatic braking system activates when the distance to the vehicle in front becomes critical, preventing rear-end collisions. Visual and auditory feedback mechanisms inform the driver when the vehicle stops due to distance-based braking. Additionally, an emergency brake activation system is included, enabling immediate braking in critical situations. Overall, this integrated safety module revolutionizes automobile safety by minimizing accidents caused by inadequate distance or driver error.

#### Main Features

##### Automatic Braking System

The module incorporates a responsive emergency brake system that detects imminent dangers using ultrasonic sensors .This rapid braking capability helps prevent collisions and reduces the severity of accidents.

##### Throttle Control

This car safety module offers precise control over the vehicle's throttle response. By integrating with the existing throttle mechanism, drivers can limit the speed or acceleration of their cars, especially in hazardous situations. This feature helps prevent accidents caused by sudden acceleration or excessive speed.
